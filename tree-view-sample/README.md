# Views & View Containers

This sample shows how to register and implement a custom tree view using the VS Code API. It has implementation for following views

- Node dependencies view
- Json Outline view
- Ftp file explorer view

These views help you in understanding how to use TreeView API, title actions, inline actions, context menu actions and how to use `when` context to show views and actions.

You can also learn how to contribute custom view containers and contribute views to it. For eg., Node dependencies view is shown under a Package Explorer custom view container.
